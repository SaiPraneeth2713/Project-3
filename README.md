# Project on Netwok Port Scanner
#READ.me
 Network Port Scanner :

A simple Python tool I built to scan a target host for open TCP ports, figure out what services are likely running on them, and flag anything that looks risky from a security standpoint.

I made this mainly as a way to get hands-on with socket programming and basic network security concepts — it's not meant to compete with tools like Nmap, just to understand how port scanning actually works under the hood.

 What it does :

- Scans TCP ports on any host you point it at
- Tells you which ports are open and which are closed
- Makes a reasonable guess at what service is running on each open port
- Rates each finding as Low, Medium, or High risk
- Rolls everything up into an overall risk level for the target
- Spits out a clean scan report at the end
- Runs fast thanks to threading

Built with :

- Python 3.x
- Sockets, for the actual scanning
- Threading, to speed things up
- Basic IP validation and hostname resolution

Project layout :

```
Network-Port-Scanner/
│── scanner.py
│── risk_assessment.py
│── utils.py
│── requirements.txt
│── README.md
└── reports/

 Getting it running :

Grab the code:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-port-scanner.git
cd network-port-scanner


Install whatever it needs:
In bash :
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running a scan :

In bash
python scanner.py


It will ask you for a target — just type in an IP or a hostname :

Target: scanme.nmap.org


Output :


=========================================
Network Port Scanner
=========================================
Target: scanme.nmap.org
Open Ports
22    SSH               LOW
80    HTTP              MEDIUM
443   HTTPS             LOW
445   SMB               HIGH
Highest Overall Risk: HIGH
Scan Completed Successfully
```

How the risk levels work in the project :

| Risk Level | What it means |
|------------|---------------|
| Low | A common service, nothing unusual about it being open |
| Medium | Worth a second look — make sure it's configured properly |
| High | A sensitive or historically-abused service; probably deserves attention |

Worth being clear about: a "High" rating just means the service *could* be a soft spot, not that anything has actually been broken into. It's a flag to investigate, not a verdict.

 Step by step procedure :

1. Take in a target (IP or hostname)
2. Resolve the hostname to an IP if needed
3. Go through the chosen port list one by one (in parallel, via threads)
4. Note which ones respond as open
5. Match each open port against a list of known services
6. Assign a risk level based on that match
7. Work out and display the single highest risk found across all open ports

Ports it knows about out of the box :

| Port | Service | Default Risk |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 21 | FTP | Medium |
| 22 | SSH | Low |
| 23 | Telnet | High |
| 25 | SMTP | Medium |
| 53 | DNS | Low |
| 80 | HTTP | Medium |
| 110 | POP3 | Medium |
| 143 | IMAP | Medium |
| 443 | HTTPS | Low |
| 445 | SMB | High |
| 3306 | MySQL | High |
| 3389 | RDP | High |
